# Building your content

No matter how well written, content in MDITA is not much use on its own. We have to transform it into a target format that readers can actually use. Generally this is some form of HTML or, perhaps, PDF.

The transformation of MDITA content is achieved using the DITA Open Toolkit. This can be run directly from GitHub using GitHub actions, or via a CI/CD platform like Jenkins, or locally from the command line or even within Oxygen XML Author.
