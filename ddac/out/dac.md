# Docs as code

In the last 4-5 years, an approach to software documentation writing, management, and publication kown as docs-as-code \(or sometimes docs-like-code\) has become increasingly popular. The philosophy, as expounded in works like Anne Gentle's [Docs like code](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Docs_Like_Code.html?id=krM7DwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) aims to integrate technical documentation in the software development lifecycle more closely than ever before.

For Gentle and other proponents, docs-as-code means treating documentation in exactly the same as source code:

-   > Store the docs source files in a version control system

-   > Build the doc artifacts automatically

-   > Ensure that a trusted set of reviewers meticulously reviews the docs

-   > Publish the artifacts without much human intervention


> \(Gentle *et. al*, 2016\)

Going even further, the docs-as-code approach allows technical writers to:

-   Use the same tools for writing does as developers use for writing code

-   Write the docs in plain text mark-up as used by software developers

-   Store documentation in the same repositories the source code, if desired

-   Integrate into agile development teams more closely

-   Use the same tools for tracking work and issues as for code


The popularity of Agile development methodologies, the emergence of the Git version control system, the move to keep source code in online repositories in GitHub, Gitlab, BitBucket etc. have also driven technical writers to adapt their tools and processes to this new evironment to a more developer-centric model.
