# A simple editor layout

The final thing that I think can contribute to making the life of DITA newbie easier is a custom editor layout that only shows the Oxygen windows that a new user is most likely to use. In my experience, in addition to the main editor pane of course, these are:

-   DITA Maps manager

-   Elements

-   Attributes

-   DITA Reusable Components


You may have your own preferences, but sharing your favorite editor layout could not be easier. Click **Window**\>**Export Layout**, give the layout a name and save it to a location such as GitHub repository from where it can be shared as a `.layout` file.
