# Configuring the custom framework location

Having set up a location for the custom frameworks, the next step is to tell Oxygen where to find it:

1.  In the Oxygen UI, go to **Options**\>**Preferences**\>**Document Type Association**\>**Locations**, and click **Add**.

2.  In the **Choose frameworks directory** dialog that appears, navigate to the `custom_ frameworks` folder, and click **OK**.

    The path to your `custom_ frameworks` folder appears in the **Additional frameworks directories** list.

3.  Click **OK** to save.


**Note:** If you plan to continue on to the next part, you can skip the final step here and continue working the **Preferences** dialog.
