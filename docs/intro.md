# Hello

![Chewbacca and Michael McLoughlin](media/wookie1.jpg)

I am Michael McLoughlin, a professional technical writer based in Belfast, N. Ireland.

If you are looking at this site, it's because I have sent it as an example of some of technical writing - probably as part of a job application. 

It's difficult for technical writers to showcase their skills since, more often than not, they don't own the copyright to their work. To remedy this, I have provided some pieces I have written on a variety of technical writing topics.

Most of the content here covers esoteric DITA and DocOps subjects that I have researched to solve real world documentation problems that I have encountered.

Feel free to look around.
